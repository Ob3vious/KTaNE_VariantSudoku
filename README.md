# Variant Sudoku
This module is the result of a modding tutorial on puzzle generation.
The module uses an algorithm that uses:
- Wave Function Collapse (a small adjustment to randomised DFS using the entropy of a cell)
- Gradual Unconstraining (not sure what the algorithm is called but I reinvented the wheel here)
